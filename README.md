# Data Cleaning Projects

This repository contains data cleaning and preprocessing projects using Python and Pandas. Two different datasets have been cleaned step-by-step to prepare them for analysis and machine learning.

## Datasets

1. **Titanic Dataset**  
   - Cleaned missing values  
   - Removed duplicates  
   - Encoded categorical columns  

2. **Second Dataset**  
   - Handled missing data  
   - Removed duplicates  
   - Transformed columns for analysis

## Steps Followed

1. Loaded dataset using Pandas  
2. Checked for missing values using `isnull()`  
3. Filled missing values with mean/median/mode  
4. Checked and removed duplicate rows using `duplicated()`   
5. Saved cleaned dataset for further analysis
